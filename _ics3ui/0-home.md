## Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science - ICS3UI! 

In this course, students will learn computer programming to creatively solve various problems. Student will learn how to analyze a problem, develop a plan to solve that problem, program the solution, and finally verify that their solution is correct. They will also use proper software development practices while completing their solutions.

Topics Include:
* Basic Input and Output
* Constants and Variables
* Conditions
* Repetition
* Methods
* Arrays
* Graphical User Interface
* Error Checking
* Debugging and Testing
* Software Development and Problem Solving
* Pseudocode and Flowcharts

In this course, students will learn to program Java using the online platform [Repl.it](http://repl.it). This allows students to program without having to install any software and on almost any device that can connect to the internet. 


## Essential Learnings:
Course credit is earned upon successful demonstration of essential learnings, which are derived from the Ministry of Education course strands and overall expectations. Final marks are calculated based on the teacherâ€™s assessment, evaluation and professional judgment as these relate to the body of evidence produced by the student. A passing mark on the final exam and/or course culminating activities does not guarantee a passing mark for that course. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that students complete and submit all work that is to be assessed and/or evaluated.
